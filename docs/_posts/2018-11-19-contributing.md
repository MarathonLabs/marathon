Contributions to Marathon's source are welcome! Here is a quick guide where to start.

# Setup

* Install [Oracle JDK][1]
* Install your IDE of choice that supports Kotlin and Gradle, e.g. [IntelliJ IDEA CE][2]
* Install a git client to checkout the repository, e.g. [GitHub Desktop][3]

Then checkout the marathon repository and open the project in your IDE.

## Contribution workflow

All the issues are tracked in GitHub, so check the [issue tracker][4] and [project board][5] for a list of something to work on.
Alternatively you can submit an issue and then work on it. Before you do that you're highly encouraged to check if this issue is not already
closed and talk with us using our [slack channel][6].

Once you pick your issue please assign yourself to work on it.

All the issues relevant to a specific version are assigned to a GitHub milestone so if the issue you're working on is required to fixed for
the next version we'll add it to the current milestone.

## Getting the source code

You can get the source code of marathon by cloning the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarathonLabs/marathon.git
```

If you plan to submit changes to the repo then please fork the project in GitHub. If you commit frequently then we can add you to the main
repository also.

## Included run configurations for IntelliJ IDEA

Marathon's project has built-in run configurations for executing included sample projects:

![html report home page]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/idea-run-configurations.png "IntelliJ Run Configurations")

You can use this setup to quickly debug something on a sample app or you can change the workdir of the configuration and debug your own
codebase. Default configurations for IntelliJ use CLI version of marathon.

## Building the project

### CLI

While working on an issue it's much faster to use CLI distribution which you can build using the ```:cli:installDist``` task in gradle. This
task builds marathon binary with all of its dependencies. The output binary can be found at ```cli/build/install/marathon/bin/marathon```.
If you use this output frequently consider changing your
path ```export PATH=$PATH:$MARATHON_CHECKOUT_DIR/cli/build/install/marathon/bin/marathon```.

If you want to create a distributable zip:

```bash
$ ./gradlew :cli:distZip
$ ls cli/build/distributions
marathon-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

### marathon-gradle-plugin

In order to test gradle plugin changes we install all modules into a maven structured folder. Unfortunately you can't use gradle plugins
with *SNAPSHOT* version, so in order to test your changes via gradle plugin you have to publish a release version of marathon which gets
quite cumbersome, that's why preferred method of testing for development purposes is the CLI.

In order to install all packages into *build/repository* folder you need to
execute ```./gradlew publishDefaultPublicationToLocalRepository -PreleaseMode=RELEASE```

After that you need to sync your project. By default, all sample projects depend on this local folder and pick up marathon from there. If
it's not working check that you actually built everything related to the plugin and the version that you specified in sample project and the
one that's published match.

## Testing changes

Before trying to execute real tests try executing unit and integration tests via ```./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport integrationTest```
command. Assuming everything passes check relevant sample project where you can test your changes. If your change is related to the core
part then you must check that both android and ios vendor implementations will not be affected.

## Code Style

Before pushing your changes please check if our linter (*detekt*) passes via ```./gradlew clean detektCheck``` command.

# General overview of modules

**core** - This is the main logic part of the runner.

**marathon-gradle-plugin** - This is a gradle plugin implementation for Android testing

**vendor** - This is custom vendor implementation related to specific platform. One specific implementation that is important is
vendor-test, this is a fake implementation that we're using for integration testing

**report** - This is a group of modules which implement various reports that marathon generates after the build

**cli** - This is the command-line interface wrapper for Marathon

**analytics:usage** - This is an analytics implementation that we're using for tracking anonymised usage of marathon.
