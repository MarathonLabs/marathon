# Choosing the distribution

By default, everyone should try using CLI first. Gradle plugin is only applicable to Android project.

If you're using any version before 0.7.0, there were some caveats to using the gradle plugin, e.g. incompatible gradle versions between the
plugin and your project, incompatible libraries which in the end required changes to gradle configuration such as Kotlin DSL plugin or
Coroutines. This is not the case anymore.

## CLI

Grab the latest release from [GitHub Releases][1] page. Extract the archive into your apps folder and add the binary to your path using
local terminal session or using your profile file (.bashrc or equivalent), e.g.

```bash
unzip -d $DESTINATION marathon-X.X.X.zip
export PATH=$PATH:$DESTINATION/marathon-X.X.X/bin
```

## MacOS

Grab the latest release with [homebrew][5]:

```bash
brew tap malinskiy/tap
brew install malinskiy/tap/marathon
```

## Gradle

Marathon gradle plugin is published as an official Gradle plugin since version 0.8.0.
To apply the plugin:
{% tabs gradle-official %} {% tab gradle-official .gradle %}
```kotlin
plugins {
    id 'com.malinskiy.marathon' version 'X.X.X'
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab gradle-official .kts %}
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.malinskiy.marathon") version "X.X.X"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Using gradle plugin <0.8.0
Before v0.8.0 marathon plugin had id "marathon" instead of "com.malinskiy.marathon". Apply such plugin directly from [MavenCentral][2] as following:

{% tabs gradle %} {% tab gradle .gradle %}
```kotlin
plugins {
    id 'marathon' version 'X.X.X'
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab gradle .kts %}
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("marathon") version "X.X.X"
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You also need to add the following to your settings.gradle(.kts) if you're using an old version before 0.8.0:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.id == "marathon") {
                useModule("com.malinskiy.marathon:marathon-gradle-plugin:${requested.version}")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

All the relevant test tasks should start with **marathon** prefix such as *marathonDebugAndroidTest*.
