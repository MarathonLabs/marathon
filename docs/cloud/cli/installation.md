This section of the documentation explains how to install the Marathon CLI on your local machine. 
For running tests within your Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) system, please refer to the [CI/CD section](./cicd).
The installation can be performed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Here’s how to add the MarathonLabs repository:
```shell
brew tap malinskiy/tap
```
Next, install the Marathon Cloud CLI:

```shell
brew install malinskiy/tap/marathon-cloud
```
Alternatively, you can download prebuilt binaries for Windows, Linux, 
or MacOS from [the Release page](https://github.com/MarathonLabs/marathon-cloud-cli/releases).
