/**
 * @property ANY_SUCCESS test passes if any of executions is passing
 *  this mode works only if there is no complex sharding strategy applied
 *  
 *  Why: it doesn't make sense when user asks for N number of tests
 *  to run explicitly, and we pass on the first one. Sharding used to verify probability of passing with an explicit boundary for precision
 * @property ALL_SUCCESS test passes if and only if all the executions are passing
 *  this mode works only if there are no retries, i.e. no complex flakiness strategy, no retry strategy
 *  
 *  Why: when adding retries to tests with retry+flakiness strategies users want to trade-off cost for reliability, i.e. add more retries
 *  and pass if one of them passes, so retries only make sense for the [ANY_SUCCESS] mode. When we use [ALL_SUCCESS] mode it means user
 *  wants to verify each test with a number of tries (they are not retries per se) and pass only if all of them succeed. This is the case
 *  when fixing a flaky test or adding a new test, and we want to have a signal that the test is fixed/not flaky.
