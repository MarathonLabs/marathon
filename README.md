# Marathon
Cross-platform test runner written for Android and iOS projects

## Main focus
- **stability** of test execution adjusting for flakiness in the environment and in the tests.
- **performance** using high parallelization (handling dozens of devices)

## Documentation

Please check the official [documentation](https://marathonlabs.github.io/marathon/) for installation, configuration and more

## [iOS Only] Added Support to consume tags for test functions under XCTestCase Subclasses
You can now tag to your iOS UITests just like you would add tag to your feature file (if you are using [Cucumberish](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Cucumberish) or [XCTGherkin](https://cocoapods.org/pods/XCTest-Gherkin))
_(Multiline tag support is not yet there. Pls make sure that tag is added just above the func signature)_
> How to tag your UITests. See Sample below.
```
    // @Flowers @apple @mock-batch-1
    func testButton() {
        let button = app.buttons.firstMatch
        XCTAssertTrue(button.waitForExistence())
        XCTAssertTrue(button.isHittable)
        button.tap()
        let label = app.staticTexts.firstMatch
        XCTAssertTrue(label.waitForExistence())
    }
```

> Tag reference in marathon file. (See last line)
